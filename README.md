# Housing-Data-Manipulation-with-Pandas

In this project I have applied essential and useful techniques for data analysis in solving a real-world problem with key Python data analysis libraries: pandas and numpy.

I have performed following steps to do this project.

 * data loading
 * data frame creation
 * selection and query, grouping and function applying, plotting
 * writing data to file.
 
 
 I have commented my code to explain my project step by step
